🧠 Comprehensive Experiment Description

This experiment demonstrates a practical data lineage and quality-monitoring workflow for a research-grade machine learning pipeline. The process includes loading a dataset, validating its integrity, logging metadata lineage, applying quality constraints, performing cleaning steps, and exporting a refined version of the data. Through this workflow, the experiment highlights how transparency, traceability, and data governance form essential pillars in reliable and reproducible AI systems — especially when dealing with research datasets or regulated environments.

✏️ Objective

To implement a lightweight yet rigorous data quality and lineage tracking pipeline using open-source tools, demonstrating how researchers can maintain data trustworthiness and trace transformation steps prior to model training.

📘 Results

Dataset was imported successfully from a public repository.

Data quality checks confirmed valid numeric ranges and categorical consistency.

A lineage log containing schema, record counts, column names, and dataset hash was generated and stored.

Dataset was cleaned through removal of null and duplicate entries.

A clean CSV version of the dataset was exported, ready for downstream machine-learning workflows.

This process shows how data validation + lineage + cleaning can be combined into a reproducible research-level pipeline.

📗 Notes

Demonstrates a minimal yet effective lineage mechanism using hash-logging and metadata capture.

Quality validation was performed using statistical checks within Pandas.

This design can be expanded to real enterprise pipelines by integrating metadata catalogs, workflow schedulers, and data-governance frameworks.

The approach supports reproducibility, auditability, and scientific rigor in advanced research settings.
